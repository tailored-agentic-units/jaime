## Dev-workflow v0.1.0: objective and phase transitions

After completing the first Objective for the kernel, hit an immediate workflow gap: there was no mechanism in the dev-workflow skill to transition between objectives. The `plan` command created phases and objectives from scratch, but had no awareness of what was already in progress. Finishing an objective meant manually closing GitHub issues, clearing `_project/objective.md`, and figuring out what to do with any incomplete sub-issues — all outside the structured workflow that handled everything else.

Split the monolithic `planning` command into dedicated `phase` and `objective` sub-commands (`/dev-workflow phase`, `/dev-workflow objective <issue>`). Each now begins with a transition closeout step that only fires when a previous phase or objective exists. The closeout assesses completion status on GitHub, presents a summary, and asks the user to disposition any incomplete work — either carry it forward to the next objective/phase or move it to the backlog. The core principle: no orphaned issues. Sub-issues are never left attached to a closed objective. Carry-forward items get atomically re-parented to the new objective via GitHub's `addSubIssue(replaceParent: true)` mutation after the new objective is created, and only then is the old objective closed.

Also removed `_project/` document archival entirely. The previous convention archived `phase.md` to `_project/.archive/phase.NN.md` during releases, but the GitHub project board, issues, and milestones already serve as the historical record. Keeping stale planning documents in the repository risks corrupting context — the AI reads everything in `_project/` during session bootstrapping, and outdated phase details from three phases ago are noise at best, misleading at worst.

Other cleanup: renamed all command files to match their command names directly (`concept-development.md` → `concept.md`, `task-execution.md` → `task.md`, etc.), removed project-specific language ("subsystem status", "skeleton to complete") that had leaked from the kernel project into what should be project-agnostic workflow commands, and added a remediation convention to the task execution template for capturing blockers discovered during developer execution.
