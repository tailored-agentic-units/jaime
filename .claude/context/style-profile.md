# Writing Style Profile — Jaime Still

Generated from analysis of 5 weekly update emails and 3 technical concept documents.

> **Note**: The email samples were pasted directly from Outlook and lack proper markdown formatting. The style patterns described here reflect the author's intent and voice, not the formatting limitations of the source medium. All blog content should use proper markdown structure including headers, markdown anchor links, fenced code blocks, and standard list syntax.

## Voice Characteristics

### Tone

- Professional and confident without being stiff
- Conversational warmth layered over technical substance
- Enthusiasm is genuine but controlled — expressed through the work itself, not hyperbole
- First person singular ("I") for direct work, first person plural ("we") for collaborative or organizational framing

### Register

- Formal enough for leadership and stakeholder communication
- Informal enough to feel like a person talking, not a report being read
- Never uses jargon without immediately contextualizing it for a non-technical audience

---

## Sentence Structure

### Patterns

- Opens with a short, grounding statement that sets the week's theme or context
- Follows with longer explanatory sentences that unpack the "so what"
- Uses em dashes for mid-sentence elaboration and parenthetical asides
- Semicolons appear in compound sentences that link related technical points
- Favors declarative statements — assertions over hedging

### Paragraph Construction

- Lead with the conclusion or impact, then explain how
- Paragraphs rarely exceed 4-5 sentences
- Transition between topics uses a clear section break or heading, not transitional phrases

### Cadence

- Short sentence, long explanatory sentence, medium impact sentence
- Technical detail is always followed by a "what this means" restatement

---

## Vocabulary Fingerprint

### Technical-to-Conversational Ratio

- Approximately 60/40 technical/conversational in updates
- Approximately 85/15 in concept documents
- Technical terms are introduced with natural-language framing: "Think of it as..." or "What this means in practice:"

### Characteristic Phrases

- "What this means in practice"
- "The net result is that..."
- "This gives us [number] immediate advantages"
- "Instead of [old way], [new capability]"
- "...available off the shelf"
- "...starting from scratch"
- "...without constant human direction"
- "...ensuring consistency and quality across..."

### Words to Favor

- establish, foundational, standardize, proven, reusable, shared, modular
- infrastructure, ecosystem, building blocks, components
- accelerate, optimize, leverage, compound
- validate, demonstrate, replicate

### Words to Avoid

- utilize (uses "use" instead)
- synergy, paradigm, disrupt (corporate buzzwords absent entirely)
- basically, simply, just (minimizes hedging language)

## Formatting Conventions

### Update Posts

- Opens with a brief context-setting introduction (what this period was about)
- Closes with a forward-looking statement
- Uses markdown headers (`##`, `###`) for topic sections
- Bullet lists and numbered lists for multi-point explanations
- [Markdown anchor links](https://example.com) to GitHub repos, PRs, and files as supporting references
- References to media (video, screenshots) for demonstrations
- Numbers and statistics quantify impact (e.g., "11,000 lines of Go code" reimplemented in "570 lines of markdown")

### Concept Documents

- Title follows pattern: `[Subject] — [Qualifier]` (e.g., "TAU Agent Runtime — Ecosystem Concept")
- Numbered top-level sections for major divisions
- Heavy use of comparison tables
- Bold for key terms on first introduction
- Bullet lists for enumerating capabilities, responsibilities, or properties
- Fenced code blocks with language hints for concrete examples
- "Current State, Gap, Target State" narrative arc
- Design philosophy stated explicitly as a guiding principle
- Analogies to well-known systems (Linux kernel, Claude Code) for grounding

## Structural Patterns

### Update Posts

1. Context-setting introduction (what this week/period was about)
2. Two to four topic sections, each with:
   - What was done
   - Why it matters
   - Links to evidence (repos, PRs, files)
3. Optional demonstration section (media references)
4. Forward-looking closing statement

### Concept Documents

1. Title and overview (1-2 sentence summary)
2. Problem statement or current state
3. Target state or proposed solution
4. Design principles and philosophy
5. Architecture details (tables, diagrams, hierarchies)
6. Implementation specifics (code examples, directory structures)
7. Testing or validation strategy
8. Key principles summary

## Audience Awareness

- Updates are written for a mixed audience: technical peers and non-technical leadership
- Concepts are written for technical implementers and architectural reviewers
- The same voice adjusts depth and framing based on audience
- Impact framing for leadership: "accelerates how quickly the organization can..."
- Technical framing for peers: specific library names, API patterns, code references
